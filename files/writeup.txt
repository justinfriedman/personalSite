TA Feedback:

- xs viewport could have a stronger layout, the columns are hard to read in
  when the page is narrow
- lacking in quantity of content


Jury Feedback:

Just the looks of the site. Some colors are a little weird and it doesn't all
look super clean. Content is good, just worth spending time on css and colors

I like the consistency of the interface, but I feel like the logos
(like the glyphicons) are a little bit big and don't necessarily show
up great on the background.. I think you have good content,
I would focus on design.

Work on more consistent formatting with color scheme and such!
Make the text a little easier to read!

But good job.


What I'm Going to Do:

I need to work on design, colors, backgrounds and icon size. I also need to work on
the xs view port. I know it was an issue the first time so I need to get it
right this time around

Jury liked content but TA wanted more. The content I currently have is all I want about me on a professionally focused site so I’m not going to add much else. 

One of the main themes in the TA and Jury feedback was that I needed to tighten
up my design and thematic coloring. I'm going to do this by better finishing the
colors, corner radius and backgrounds. 

On my home page I’m going to make the orange text easier to read on the background. 

On my what I’ve done page I’m going to focus on getting the content to display well in xs viewports. 

On my where I’m going page I’m going to work out issues with column display in all viewports and make the content more reader friendly. 

For my contact page I’m just going to change the styling a little bit. 

Throughout the entire site I’m going to fix viewport issues, color matching and general readability style issues.
