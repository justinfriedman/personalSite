        <strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> I built and opperated a Litecoin mine (created new untis of cryptocurreny) and managed and grew the profit fund. It was a incredible experiance in learning on the go and sector addaptation. Hardware for the mine was not easy to come by while we were in opperation so I also got an indepth look into Asian electronics supply chains and the larger market players globally. I was also able to gain macro insights while dealing in a micro sized economy.

      <p>
        <strong>3D Printing:</strong> I started a 3D printing services company that took user 3D files, printed and then shipped the prints back to customers. The company has had over 40 differnt clients, many with repeat orders.
